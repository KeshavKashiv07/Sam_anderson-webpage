# Style a Professional Portfolio 

## Context 
Sam Anderson has been working as a Graphic Designer in London for several years. He now plans to expand his work in and outside London by having a web presence that showcases his work. Sam has already designed the layout of his web page but needs help in scripting the markups and styles to realize the design.​

Sam had assigned this work to a local FrontEnd Developer, but the developer had some challenges and unfortunately could only produce the markup. Sam now needs help in styling the web page such that it gives a great user-experience to attract his customers.​

### Tasks

- The solution for this practice can be developed in 4 steps:​​​​
    - Step 1: Define styles in`style.css` file located in `css` folder of the boilerplate​​​​.
    - Step 2: Link the styles.css file with index.html​​ using `<link>` tag​​.
    - Step 3: Link the predefined stylesheets for fonts in `index.html` file​.
    - Step 4: Apply styles defined using class or id selector to the page elements​.

- CSS Properties like color, background-color, display, list-style, font, margin, padding, border, width, line-height, letter-spacing, text related properties should be used to achieve the expected output. 

- Below is the list of predefined stylesheets that need to be added inside the `index.html` for formatting fonts.
